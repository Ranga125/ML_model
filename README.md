    <h1>Mushroom Edibility Classifier</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project implements a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on various features. It includes a frontend developed using React, a backend using Django, and deployment using Docker. The goal is to provide an end-to-end machine learning solution, from data preprocessing to model deployment.</p>
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>The project is divided into several key components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The initial step involves cleaning and preprocessing the mushroom dataset to remove any inconsistencies and prepare the data for training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Feature engineering is performed to create meaningful features that can improve the model's performance. This step involves selecting relevant features and transforming them as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Multiple machine learning models are trained using algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and RandomForestClassifier. These models are then evaluated based on their accuracy and other performance metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Serialization:</strong> The trained models are serialized using <code>pickle</code>. This allows the models to be saved and loaded later without needing to retrain them. Serialization is crucial for deploying the models in a production environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend Interface:</strong> A user-friendly interface is developed using React. This interface allows users to input mushroom features and receive predictions on whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous. The frontend communicates with the backend via API requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend API:</strong> The backend, built using Django, handles API requests from the frontend. It processes the input features, loads the serialized models, and returns predictions. The backend ensures that the application can scale and handle multiple requests efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Docker Deployment:</strong> The entire application, including the frontend, backend, and machine learning models, is containerized using Docker. Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
        <li>SVM (Support Vector Machine)</li>
        <li>RandomForestClassifier</li>
        <li>Pickle</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Django</li>
        <li>Docker</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Once the servers are running, you can access the application in your browser. Use the interface to input mushroom features and get predictions on whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous. The frontend provides a seamless user experience, while the backend ensures robust handling of the machine learning predictions.</p>
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>The application can be deployed using Docker. Docker containerizes the entire application, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. This simplifies the deployment process and ensures that the application can scale to handle more users and requests.</p>
    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. You can also open issues for any bugs or feature requests. Contributions help improve the project and add new features, making it more robust and versatile.</p>
